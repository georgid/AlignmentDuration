LONG: Lyrics are one of the most important aspects of vocal music.
 When a performance is heard, most listeners will fol- low the lyrics of
 the main vocal melody.

\color black
The task of lyrics synchronisation (a.k.a.
 lyrics-to-audio alignment) has as an aim to find in an automatic way a
 match between two musical respresentations of a composition: the singing
 voice and the corresponding lyrics.
 Tracking lyrics may be used to automatically outline the structure of an
 audio recording (inferred from lyric), which can be beneficial for musicologist
s or singing students.

The problem of lyrics-to-audio alignment has inherent relation to text-to-speech
 alignment.
 
\color inherit
Text-to-speech alignment has been a research field for more than 20 years
 and thus yielded established successful ways for modeling phonemes.
 However, Compared to speech, singing voice has some substantially different
 characteristics: harmonics, pitch range, pronunciation, vibrato, etc.
 In particular, unlike speech, for singing voice, durations of vocals have
 on average somewhat higher variation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "kruspekeyword"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that applying an approach from speech recognition out of
 the box might not lead to satisfactory results.
 Traditional music poses an additional challenge: as a way to express an
 emphasis, singers might prolong particular syllables to a duration substantiall
y longer compared to other syllables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, a confinement of current work on modeling lyrics is imposed by
 the necessity of a large speech corpus, on which phoneme models are typically
 trained

In this study 
\color black
we propose how to automatically align singing voice to lyrics by a probabilistic
 approach, which models explicitly phoneme durations.
 Phoneme models are trained directly on annotated singing voice.
 
\color inherit
We show that incorporating some prior expectation of syllable durations,
 based on musical principles, brings improvement over a baseline method.
 The approach is tested on material from Jingju opera (also known as Beijing
 or Peking opera), which is characterized by its particularly long syllable
 durations.

Background on Jingju opera music principles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lyrics in Jingju opera come from poetry and are thus commonly structured
 into couplets: each couplet has two lyrics lines.
 A line is usually divided into 3 syllable groups: a group is called 
\emph on
dou
\emph default
 and consists of 2 to 4 written characters

term

\emph default
as equivalent to one written character.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 To emphasize the semantics of a phrase or according to the plot, an actor
 has the option to sustain the vocal of the dou’s final syllable.
 In this work we will refer to the final syllable of a 
\emph on
dou 
\emph default
as 
\emph on
key syllable.

HMMs have been originally developed to model speech phonemes for applications
 like text-to-speech alignment.
 HMMs have the drawback that in general they are not capable to represent
 well vowels with long and highly-variable durations, because the waiting
 time in a state in traditional HMMs cannot be unlimitedly long

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "approach overview"

\end_inset

.
 First an audio recording is manually divided into sentences as indicated
 in the lyrics script of the aria, whereby instrumental-only sections are
 discarded.
 All further steps are performed on each audio segment.
 If we had used automatic segmentation instead, potential erroneous lyrics
 and features could have biased the comparison of a baseline system and
 DHMM.
 As we focus on evaluating the effect of DHMM, manual segmentation is preferred.

 an expected reference duration.

 example, structure of lyrics segments

To define a glass ceiling accuracy, alignment was performed considering
 phoneme annotations as an oracle for acoustic features.
 Looking at phoneme annotations, we set the probability of a phoneme to
 1 during its time interval and 0 otherwise.
 We found that the median accuracy per a sentence of lyrics is close to
 100%, which means that the model is generally capable of handling the highly-va
rying vocal durations of Jingju singing.
 Most optimal results were obtained with
